05.03.2010 - ArcSim Version 1.2 released.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The major improvement to the previous release is the integration of a cycle
accurate model into '--fast' mode (i.e. JIT DBT mode). Here is a selection of
further major improvements:

- Implemented '--fast' '--cycle' accurate mode that is 'almost' as accurate as
  interpretive cycle accurate mode.
- Much improved operand read/write macros.
- Improved definitions in state.def so that only necessary fields and types are
  emitted.
- Improve variable names of Dcode attributes.
- Improve cycle accurate structure member names of cp uState struct
- It is now possible to compile CYCLE_ACC_SIM and REGTRACK_SIM enabled simulators
  in all combinations.
- Improved disassmbly output for interpretive and fast mode
- Improved output when '--reuse' flag is used in conjunction with '--debug'
- Fixed code generated for RORM instruction when dst1 and src1 (i.e. wa0 and ra0)
  are not equal in JIT engine.
- Updates to BBITn opcodes to support static branch prediction extensions
- Initialise register read/write count in cycle accurate memory model
- Adjusted decode and disasm to accept BRcc with bit 3 set to 1 (inverted branch predictor bit)
- JIT compiler is now configurable (--fast-cc) gcc is the default
- Translation mode option has been added but it has no effect yet (--fast-trans-mode)
- Fixed the screen device so that the colour's display as on the real screen
- Fixed the way how LO HI cycle count and instruction aux regs are set
- Add instruction profiling and instruction latency calculation to --fast mode
- Fixed disasm format for 'ld_s|ldb_s|ldw_s r0,[gp,s*]'
- Introduce portable types into JIT engine
- Fixed decode bug in 'J s12' format.
