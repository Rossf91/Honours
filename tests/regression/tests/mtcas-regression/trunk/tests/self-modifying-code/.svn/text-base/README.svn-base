Self Modifying Code
===================

This benchmark these benchmarks are designed to test if 
arcsim can correctly handle self-modifying code.

------
Test 1 - Self modifying on the heap
------
Should: work in both interpreted and fast mode.
Currently: returns wrong value in fast mode.

Copies a function to the heap, executes it,
and then copies a different function to the same location
on the heap, and then executes that.

Build: $ arc-elf32-gcc -mA7 -O0 -o test1 test1.c
Run:   $ bin/arcsim --emt --verbose --fast -X -e test1

Test has passed if it returns 42 (that is, r0 is 42...)

------
Test 2 - Self modifying in the .text section
------
Should: work in both interpreted and fast mode.
Currently: arcsim segfaults in fast mode.

Executes a function which runs a loop 10000000 times,
and then copies a different function to the same location
as the first function (so, in the .text area) and then 
executes that.

Build: $ arc-elf32-gcc -mA7 -O0 -o test2 test2.c
Run:   $ bin/arcsim --emt --verbose --fast -X -e test2

Test has passed if it returns 42 (that is, r0 is 42...)
