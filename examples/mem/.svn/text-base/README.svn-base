== MemoryDevice Architecture ======================================

An example of how to define a MemoryDevice is provided in the 'ExternalMemory'
sub-folder.

In order to build the sample MemoryDevice execute the following command in this
directory:

$ make

In order to test the MemoryDevice execute the following command in this
directory:

$ ../../bin/arcsim \
      --verbose \
      --debug   \
      --mem-dev-lib=ExternalMemory/ExternalMemory.so \
      -e YOUR_PROGRAM

The sample MemoryDevice is built with debug logging support and will
log every read and write to the device if the '--debug' flag is specified.
