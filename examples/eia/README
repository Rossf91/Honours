== EIA Extension Instruction Architecture ======================================

An example of how to define EIA extension is provided in the 'WhizzBangExtension'
and 'MyEiaSample' sub-folder.

In order to build the sample EIA extension execute the following command in this
directory:

$ make

In order to test the EIA extension there is a simple test program called
'TestEia.cpp' that will load an EIA extension, inspect it and call some
API methods to test the extension. In order to execute this test program
run the following in this directory:

$ ./run.sh WhizzBangExtension/EiaWhizzBangExtension.so

The arguments to the run script should be the path to the EIA extension library
that is contained within the 'WhizzBangExtension' folder.

In order to view the EIA API documentation point your browser to the 'docs/api'
folder within your ArcSim distribution.
